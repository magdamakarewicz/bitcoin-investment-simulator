# Bitcoin Investment Simulator

## Overview
Bitcoin Investment Simulator is a Spring application that allows users to calculate potential earnings from a historical Bitcoin investment. Users can input a past date and investment amount, and the app will fetch historical and current BTC prices to calculate and display potential profit or loss.

## Features
- User input for historical date and investment amount in PLN/USD.
- Fetch BTC prices from CoinDesk API.
- Calculate potential earnings and percentage gain/loss.
- Save each calculation to a database.
- Different profiles for development and production environments.

## Known Issues

### CoinDesk API
The application relies on the CoinDesk API to fetch historical and current BTC prices. Currently, there are some issues with the API which might cause errors in the applicationâ€™s functionality. These issues are beyond the control of this project and may affect the accuracy of the calculations and the overall performance of the application.

If you encounter any issues related to the CoinDesk API, please be aware that this is a known problem and is being investigated. Potential fixes or workarounds will be implemented as they become available.

## Technologies
- Java 17
- Hibernate
- MySQL (or H2 for in-memory database)
- Maven

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL (for production profile)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/magdamakarewicz/bitcoin-investment-simulator.git
    cd bitcoin-investment-simulator
    ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Configuration Profiles
   The application uses different configuration profiles for different environments:

- `dev`: Development profile using H2 in-memory database.
- `test`: Testing profile using H2 in-memory database.
- `prod`: Production profile using MySQL database.

You can specify the active profile by using the `-Dspring.profiles.active` parameter or by setting the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable.

#### Development Environment
In development mode, the application uses an in-memory H2 database. Ensure you are in the project directory.

Configure your IDE to use the `dev` profile:
- In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to "Edit Configurations", add VM options `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev`.
- In Eclipse: Go to "Run Configurations", add VM arguments `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev`.

Run the main class `com.enjoythecode.bitcoininvestmentsimulator.app.BitcoinInvestmentSimulator` from your IDE.

#### Production Environment
In production mode, the application uses a MySQL database. Make sure MySQL is installed and running.

Create a MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE bitcoininvestmentdb;
```

Update the `JpaConfig` class with your MySQL credentials if needed (not provided in this setup, but make sure it's configured properly).

Configure your IDE to use the `prod` profile:
- In IntelliJ IDEA: Go to "Edit Configurations", add VM options `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod`.
- In Eclipse: Go to "Run Configurations", add VM arguments `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod`.

Run the main class `com.enjoythecode.bitcoininvestmentsimulator.app.BitcoinInvestmentSimulator` from your IDE.

4. Packaging the Application
   You can package the application into a runnable JAR file.

Build the JAR with dependencies:
```sh
mvn package
```

Run the JAR file with the desired profile (e.g., prod):
```sh
java -jar target/BitcoinInvestmentSimulator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

## Environment Configuration

### Overview
In the project, various environments have been defined, including production, development, and testing. The configuration for these environments is managed as follows:

### Production Environment

In the production environment, settings are defined directly within the methods of the `JpaConfig` class, leveraging MySQL as the database.

### Development and Testing Environments

For development and testing environments, a combination of environment variables and the `application.properties` file is utilized. This setup allows for flexible configuration of database access credentials, with H2 used as the database.

To modify the configuration for the development environment, adjustments should be made to the `application.properties` file accordingly.
